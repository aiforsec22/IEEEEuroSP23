Firstly O
, O
the O
prediction O
performance O
of O
SW-SVR ATK
sometimes O
deteriorates O
despite O
an O
increase O
of O
training ATK
data ATK
. O

In O
particular O
, O
this O
problem O
occurred O
under O
the O
conditions O
that O
prediction O
horizons O
are O
6 O
h O
as O
shown O
in O
Fig O
. O

3 O
. O

This O
is O
because O
data O
extracted O
by O
D-SDC ATK
involves O
unnecessary O
training ATK
data ATK
for O
highly O
accurate O
prediction O
. O

If O
D-SDC ATK
extracts O
the O
same O
data O
as O
the O
extracted O
data O
when O
training O
periods O
are O
shorter O
, O
the O
prediction O
performance O
of O
SW-SVR ATK
never O
deteriorates O
due O
to O
an O
increase O
of O
training ATK
data ATK
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
must O
review O
both O
feature O
mapping O
and O
algorithms O
of O
D-SDC ATK
so O
as O
to O
avoid O
extracting O
unnecessary O
training ATK
data ATK
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
SW-SVR ATK
is O
based O
on O
a O
combination ATK
of ATK
several ATK
algorithms ATK
: O

PLS ATK

, O

, O
D-SDC ATK

and O
linear ATK
SVR ATK
. O

Moreover O
, O
each O
algorithm O
has O
several O
parameters O
. O

Therefore O
, O
SW-SVR ATK
has O
more O
varied O
parameters O
, O
and O
it O
takes O
more O
time O

the ATK

In O

we O
used O

In O
fact O
, O
there O
are O
more O

since O
many O

the O

that O

written O

terms O
of O
VV O
final O

, O
while O
others O
are O
have O
PP O
states O
. O

There O
are O
three O
reasons O
for O
this O
. O

First O
, O
some O
decays ATK
involve O
a O
final-state O
π0 O
. O

However O
, O
experimentally O
it O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
find ATK
the ATK
decay ATK
vertices ATK
of O
the O
final ATK
particles ATK
. O

This O
is O
virtually O
impossible O
for O
a O
π0 O
, O
and O
so O
we O
always O
use O
a O
ρ0 O
. O

Second O
, O
some O
pairs ATK
of ATK
decays ATK
are O
related O
by O
SU O
( O
3 O
) O
in O
the O
SM ATK
only O
if O
an O
( O
ss¯ O
) O
quark ATK
pair ATK
is O
used O
. O

However O
, O
there O
are O
no O
P O
's O
which O
are O
pure O
( O
ss¯ O
) O
. O

The O
mesons ATK
η ATK
and O
η′ ATK
have O
an O
( O
ss¯ O
) O
component O
, O
but O
they O
also O
have O
significant O
( O
uu¯ O
) O
and O
( O
dd¯ O
) O
pieces O
. O

As O
a O
result O
the O
b¯→s¯ O
and O
b¯→d¯ O
decays ATK
are O
not O
really O
related O
by O
SU O
( O
3 O
) O
in O
the O
SM ATK
if O
the O
final O
state O
involves O
an O
η ATK
or O
η′ ATK
. O

We O
therefore O
consider O
instead O
the O
vector ATK
meson ATK
ϕ ATK
which O
is O
essentially O
a O
pure O
( O
ss¯ O
) O
quark ATK
state ATK
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
require O
that O
both O
B0 ATK
and O
B¯0 ATK
be O
able O
to O
decay ATK
to ATK
the ATK
final ATK
state ATK
. O

This O
can O
not O
happen O
if O
the O
final O
state O
contains O
a O
single O
K0 O
( O
or O
K¯0 O
) O
meson ATK
. O

However O
, O
it O
can O
occur O
if O
this O
final-state ATK
particle ATK
is O
an O
excited ATK
neutral ATK
kaon ATK
. O

In O
this O
case O
one O
decay ATK
involves O
K ATK
* ATK
0 ATK
, O
while O
the O
other O
has O
K¯ ATK
* ATK
0 ATK
. O

Assuming O
that O
the O
vector ATK
meson ATK
is O
detected O
via O
its O
decay ATK
to ATK
ψKsπ0 ATK
( O

of ATK
sin2β ATK

Bd0 O

t O

* O
) O
, O
then O
both O
B0 ATK
and O
B¯0 ATK
can O
decay O
to O
the O
same O
final O
state O

Many O
years O

inspired O

proposed O
the O

analogy O
with O
Dirac ATK

After O

there O
was O
considerable O
debate O
on O
how O
a O

may O
be O
formulated O

Eventually O
, O
't O
Hooft O

Polyakov O
showed O
that O

exists O
as O

in O
certain O
non-abelian ATK

Most O

now O
believe O
that O

merely O
a O
piece O

and O
that O

exist O
. O

Might O
it O
not O
turn O
out O
that O
Einstein O

is O
but O
a O
piece O
of O
a O
bigger O
theory O
and O
that O
gravitipoles ATK
exist O
? O

In O
grand O
unified O
theory O
the O
electromagnetic ATK
field ATK
is O
a O
component O

a O

. O

Could O
it O
be O
that O
the O
gravitational ATK
field ATK
also O
somehow O
carries O
an O
internal O

that O
the O

we O
observe O

just O

This O

Previous O

been O
procured O

the O
contractor O

the O
detailed ATK

. O

For O
this O
system O
the O
design O
was O
undertaken O
by O
Mott O
MacDonald O
. O

It O
was O
developed O
by O
looking ATK
at ATK
the ATK

installed ATK
previously ATK

calculating ATK
what O
was O
actually O
required O
to O
achieve O
cathodic ATK

This O
resulted O
in O
a O
significant ATK
reduction ATK
in ATK

The O
varying ATK

the O

had O
previously O
lead O

up O

with O
multiple ATK

On O

the O

the O
operating O
current O
density O
was O
similar O
in O
all O

so O
this O
was O
reduced O
to O
a O
single O
zone O

. O

The O
encapsulation ATK
was O
susceptible O
to O

contained O
post O

so O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
use O
a O
galvanic ATK
system ATK
based O
on O
Galvashield ATK
CC ATK
anodes ATK
from O
Fosroc O

Our O

did O
not O
include O
an O
option O
to O
allow O
depolarization ATK
of ATK
the ATK
galvanic ATK
system ATK
, O
but O
the O
contractor O
supplied O

the O

be O
remotely O

The O

operated O
via O
a O

provided O
by O
the O

The O
displacement ATK
cascade ATK
is O
a O
rapid O
process O
( O
of O

Further O
migration ATK

mainly O

happens O
over O
a O

This O
is O
still O
short O
compared O
to O

times O

so O
is O
important O
to O
consider O
the O

result O

such O

If O

likely O
to O
find O
their O
Frenkel O

recombine O

then O
the O

should O
essentially O
return O

its O
original O

; O
however O
, O
if O
defects ATK
instead O
formed O
large O
clusters O
of O
a O

this O
could O
result O

possibly O

Defects O
can O
be O
